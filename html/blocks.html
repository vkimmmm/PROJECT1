            The block to the left is known as a Cherry Log. These cherry logs are found only in the Cherry Blossom Biome of the game.
            In Minecraft, there are different biomes you can come across. The Cherry Blossom Biome is probably one of the best biomes to discover
            for all things pink! This wooden block in particular can be picked up by knocking it down with your bare hands or by crafting an axe.
            With this wood, you can make all sorts of things like cherry blossom planks, stairs, etc. You can even plant down more of these types 
            of trees if the trees drop cherry blossom saplings.

                The block to the left is known as a Stripped Cherry Log. It comes from a cherry blossom tree.
                You obtain this type of log by building an axe and stripping a regular cherry log to turn into this shade of pink. These logs also come from
                the same trees as the Cherry Logs right above this block. The only difference is that you need an axe and to take an additional step of
                stripping the logs by right clicking them with your axe. Good thing that crafting an axe is easy!

                The block to the left is probably one of my favorite blocks in the game. I just think that with this block alone, it changes
                the look of a whole house in Minecraft when building. This block is called the Cherry Blossom Plank. It is crafted by taking
                Cherry Logs. The great thing about planks are that you can get 4 planks for 1 log!
