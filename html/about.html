            PinkCraft is just a means of information on all the pink things in the game Minecraft! The main game "Minecraft"
            is a game that emphasizes on all things pixels. If you look closely at everything in the game, you will be able to notice
            that everything can be seen as square pixels. The whole point of Minecraft is to build and survive in this pixelated world.
            The person on the right is the default icon of what your "person" will look like in game. However, you can change the look
            of many things such as appearance and how your game appears. Below, I have attached a Minecraft for Beginners Guide!
